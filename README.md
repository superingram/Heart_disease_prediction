This is my most thorough work to date as far as model hyperparameter tuning and use of visualization.  Several machine learning models are utilized here such as SVC, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, AdaBoost and XGBoost.  Shap will be implemented for feature importance and an average feature importance will be demonstrated acroos all models except for XGBoost as that model will be introduced into Shap.  The dataset is small but this project serves as a basis for other data sets to follow.
